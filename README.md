This repository is an attempt at making a driver for the Huion Kamvas Pro 16's touchbar.  
I am also using this project as a way of learning how to retro-engineer an USB device, through diverse methods but mostly with `tshark`. This is not intended as a complete documentation of Huion Kamvas Pro 16 USB interface specification, but it can still serve as a basis for more complete and ambitious projects I guess.
